# Roadmap

## Shipped

### v0.2 (2026-09-05) — the "memory layer" release

- [x] Hybrid retrieval: vector + native BM25 fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (on by default)
- [x] **MCP server** (pulled forward from v0.3): `brain_search` / `brain_ask` / `brain_ingest` over stdio
- [x] Heading-breadcrumb chunks and section-level citations
- [x] Obsidian frontmatter tags + `search --tag`
- [x] `[[wikilink]]` graph: `links` command + `brain_links` MCP tool
- [x] `watch` mode (pure polling, no watchdog dependency)
- [x] `chat` multi-turn loop with conversation memory
- [x] Query operators: `--in` / `--since` / `-e "exact phrase"` / `--tag`
- [x] `ask --verify`: claim-by-claim faithfulness audit of answers
- [x] **Memory consolidation**: `loci wiki` / `brain_wiki` distills the index
      into curated wiki pages (with [[wikilinks]] and sources)
- [x] Fully-offline mode verified against local Ollama (embeddings + chat)
- [x] Reranking, both providers: LLM pointwise scoring + local cross-encoder
      (bge-reranker, optional extra)
- [x] Chat-log loader: ChatGPT / Claude `conversations.json` exports
- [x] MCP resources (`brain://note/…`, `brain://stats`) and prompts
      (brain-briefing / study-plan / contradiction-check)
- [x] PDF loading with table understanding (PyMuPDF4LLM → markdown pipe rows)
- [x] `.docx` loader (paragraphs + tables, optional extra)
- [x] Per-directory chunk config (`chunk_size` / `chunk_overlap` overrides)
- [x] `stats` / `doctor` / `ingest --force`
- [x] 59-test offline suite + GitHub Actions CI (Python 3.11–3.13)

### v0.1 (2026-09-03) — MVP

- [x] Recursive directory scan + markdown heading-aware chunking
- [x] OpenAI-compatible embeddings / chat (Zhipu / DeepSeek / Kimi / OpenAI all work)
- [x] ChromaDB local persistence + content-hash incremental indexing
- [x] CLI: ingest / search / ask (answers carry citations)

## Next

- [ ] More loaders: HTML, org-mode, Notion/Markdown dumps
- [ ] Scanned-PDF / OCR route (image-only pages still yield no text)
- [ ] Incremental embedding cache (only re-embed changed chunks, not whole files)
- [ ] Web UI — deliberately last: the MCP host ecosystem is the UI layer for now

## Explorations

- [ ] Knowledge-graph mode (Neo4j, GraphRAG experiment)
- [ ] Incremental embedding cache (only re-embed changed chunks, not whole files)

## Non-goals

- Cloud storage (your data leaving the machine defeats the point)
- Multi-user (this is *my* second brain — build your own, it's ~300 lines)
- Competing with all-in-one chat platforms on breadth — see
  [the competitive landscape study](research/competitive-landscape.md) for why
